# Research Methodology: SCM Legal Domain Adaptation

## 🔬 Experimental Design

### **Research Hypothesis**
"Domain-specialized Small Concept Models (SCMs) can achieve superior performance on professional legal tasks compared to general-purpose Large Concept Models (LCMs) while maintaining edge deployment viability."

### **Primary Research Questions**

1. **RQ1**: Can conceptual reasoning capabilities be effectively distilled from LCMs into smaller, domain-specialized models?
2. **RQ2**: How does conceptual coherence in legal reasoning compare between general vs specialized models?
3. **RQ3**: What are the optimal architectural choices for edge-deployed conceptual reasoning in professional environments?
4. **RQ4**: How do SCMs perform on real-world legal workflows compared to token-based approaches?

## 📊 Evaluation Framework

### **1. Conceptual Reasoning Metrics**

#### **1.1 Conceptual Coherence Score (CCS)**
```
CCS = (Σ concept_consistency_i + cross_reference_density + ontological_alignment) / 3

Where:

- cross_reference_density: Number of valid conceptual connections / total concepts
- ontological_alignment: Adherence to legal taxonomy (0-1)
```

#### **1.2 Professional Utility Score (PUS)**
```
PUS = weighted_average(accuracy, relevance, actionability, citation_quality)

Weights: [0.3, 0.25, 0.25, 0.2] based on expert surveys
```

#### **1.3 Deployment Efficiency (DE)**
```
DE = (baseline_latency / model_latency) × (baseline_memory / model_memory) × cost_factor

Normalized to [0, 10] scale for comparison
```
