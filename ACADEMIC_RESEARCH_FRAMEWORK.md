## 1. Theoretical Foundation: Concept-Based Reasoning Extension

### 1.1 Established Research Landscape
The field of concept-based reasoning has demonstrated remarkable progress in large-scale multilingual applications. Current research emphasizes generalization capabilities across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, with models exceeding 7B parameters achieving state-of-the-art performance in conceptual understanding.
